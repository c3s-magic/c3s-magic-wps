 This tool computes the diurnal temperature variation indicator as a proxy for energy demand and the wind capacity factor as a proxy for energy supply. The diurnal temperature indicator is the number of days in a season where the daily temperature variation (tasmax - tasmin) exceeds the vulnerability threshold. Here, the vulnerability threshold is based on the mean daily temperature variation for the  reference period (1960 -1990) + 5 degrees. This definition was proposed in a study conducted for the DALKIA energy company. The capacity factor is computed using the manufacturer provided  power  curves that  relate  power  output  to  steady  winds  blowing  at  hub  height.  The capacity  factor can be derived from power curve values easily, by dividing power output by the nominal capacity of the turbine. Here the 100-m wind heights are extrapolated from the surface wind speeds.

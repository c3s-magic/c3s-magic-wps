Climate explorer allows the user to correlate a time series with other user-defined time series, as well as with system-defined time series of the same temporal resolution. The user is given the option to calculate correlation coefficients using the average of multiple months of climate data. In the example below daily observations are correlated with a timeseries using the correlate function of climate explorer. The result is written as NetCDF in the basket, a link is given which is directly visualizable.

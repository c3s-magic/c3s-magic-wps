Tool to compute extreme indices relevant to the insurance industry. These indices are based on the ETCCDI indices, and there are currently 5 available for extreme heati (tx90p), cold (tx10p), wind (wx), drought(cdd) and flooding (rx5day). The individual indices can be combined into a single index with or without weightings for each component. This combined index is roughly analagous to the Actuaries Climate Risk Index.

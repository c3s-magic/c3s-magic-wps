This tool allows the user to compute the total duration of "extreme spells"; the total number of days in a season where the temperature exceeds a threshold over a minimum number of consecutive days. Other tools for computing such events are also available, but the novelty of this tool is that the users can select their own thresholds (based on quantiles) and minimum duration for an event.
